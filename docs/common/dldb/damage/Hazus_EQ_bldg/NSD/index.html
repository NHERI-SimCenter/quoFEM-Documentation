<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Drift-Sensitive Nonstructural components primarily include architectural components, but drift demands shall also be considered as a secondary cause of damage for certain mechanical, and electrical components. Typical examples (based on Table 5.2 in the Hazus Earthquake Model Technical Manual): Nonbearing walls and partitions, Exterior wall panels, Veneer and finishes, Penthouses, Piping systems, HVAC systems, Elevators, and General electrical components. Anchorage/bracing of nonstructural components improves earthquake performance of most components although routine or typical anchorage/bracing provides only limited damage protection. It is assumed that typical nonstructural components and building contents have limited anchorage/bracing.</div>
<div class="line">Damage to drift-sensitive nonstructural components (e.g., full-height drywall partitions) is primarily a function of inter-story drift. The damage functions estimated for each group are assumed to be âtypicalâ of its sub-components. However, that damage depends on the anchorage/bracing provided to the nonstructural components.</div>
